# Create: D
The Pack: Includes almost all Create Forge addons, additionaly it has some other mods for the D.

The Quests: For Beginners/People who suddenly dont know what to do next, which means they are very detailed and have great explanations on how to find/automate all mods/important blocks in the pack.



The Idea: I created modpacks for myself which have many create addons, I just almost always spend more time tinkering on the Pack then playing it. The problem I had was that after a certain automation stage i just did not know what to do next or thought my modpack is missing some mods to be perfect.

Time spent: For initial releas [10h] / For Pack updates [+10h]
